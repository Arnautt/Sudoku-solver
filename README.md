# Sudoku-solver

Sudoku solver using backtracking algorithm. It can be used in two different ways :

- with **`sudoku.py`** and **`main.py`**. You can both generate a random Sudoku or passing a grid for the constructor.

- with **`app.py`**. Need tkinter to be installed. It is a simple GUI which allows to generate random Sudoku with its solution. You need to compile with the number of values in the initial Sudoku. For example, to generate a Sudoku with 10 original values : 

```console
python app.py 10
